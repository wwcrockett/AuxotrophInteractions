# AuxotrophInteractions
Hello! These scripts use coupled ordinary differential equations to model 2 and 3 strain microbial communities based on the Mee et al.'s 2014 paper "M. T. Mee, J. J. Collins, G. M. Church, and H. H. Wang, â€œSyntrophic exchange in synthetic
microbial communities." The foldgrowth_2member.csv and foldgrowth_3member.csv are datasets from their supplemental materials.
I recreated their model fits for two member interactions, and compared two 3-strain models: a limiting interaction model and a generalized Lotka-Volterra model.
The two R scripts perform the fit and modeling, and the BestFits.csv is produced by the Auxotroph2Strains.R script.
